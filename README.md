# Basic level Web-Crawler
A web crawler, spider, or search engine bot indexes content from all over the Internet. so that the information can be retrieved when it's needed. Web Crawler are almost always operated by search engines. By applying a search algorithm to the data collected by web crawlers.

A crawler is a computer program that automatically searches documents on the Web. Crawlers are primarily programmed for repetitive actions so that browsing is automated. Search engines use crawlers most frequently to browse the internet and build an index.

After running the project this will be the output in the terminal window.

Basically itt go through the web pages and find links, go through them & provide us web page names & web links on the terminal.
By copying the link from the terminal, pasting it on the search engine it will open up the specific web page.
That's all about the project  hope you  like it.
